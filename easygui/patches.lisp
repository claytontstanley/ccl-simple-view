; Radio buttons in 10.8 require being enclosed within an NSMatrix.
; If not (default easygui implementation), each one is assigned to the
; same virtual NSMatrix, which means they are all part of the same cluster,
; which means that the common lisp clustering implementation breaks since
; Cocoa is now forcing all radio buttons to be part of the same cluster.
; The fix is to use NSSwitchButton Cocoa functionality for radio buttons,
; but use NSRadioButton images (for selected and deselected) for the implementation.
; Another approach would have been to embed each radio button in its own NSMatrix,
; but this required much more code than the image switching technique, and it messed up the overall
; easygui design, since the cocoa-ref of a radio-button object would have been an NSMatrix,
; which breaks the view-text and (setf view-text) mixin methods, as well as auto sizing the
; view to the text it contains on init, etc. So, I went with the simple image switching hack.
