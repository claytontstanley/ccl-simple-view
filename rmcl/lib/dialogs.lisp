; FIXME: Is there any way not to use a global for this? The problem is that *modal-dialog-ret* is 
; set on a different thread than the modal dialog thread, so the cleanest way that I've
; found to communicate between threads is to use a shared global
(defparameter *modal-dialog-ret* nil)

; Use #/abortModal and not #/stopModal
